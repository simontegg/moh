title: Position statement - The Use of Puberty Blockers in Gender Affirming Care
---

## Purpose

This position statement accompanies the release of the evidence brief which examines the safety and long-term impacts of puberty blockers. This statement summarises the brief's findings and sets out the Ministry of Health's expectations regarding the use of puberty blockers for gender affirming care. It also outlines our next steps that will ensure young people with gender incongruence and dysphoria have access to quality care, and provides information for health professionals, rainbow communities, and the general public.

## Background

In September 2022, the Ministry of Health (the Ministry) updated its position on the safety and reversibility of puberty blockers when used for gender affirming care in light of work underway in other jurisdictions examining the clinical effects of puberty blockers on adolescents. The Evidence, Research and Innovation directorate within the Ministry of Health were commissioned to produce an evidence brief examining the risks and benefits of puberty blockers when used for gender affirming care.

## Why puberty blockers are prescribed

Puberty blockers, or Gonadotrophin Releasing Hormones (GnRH) agonists, can be used to delay the onset of puberty by suppressing oestrogen and testosterone. They can be prescribed by clinicians to young people experiencing gender incongruence or dysphoria.

Gender Incongruence is where an individual's experienced gender and their assigned sex (at birth) persistently do not match.

Gender dysphoria is where an individual's gender incongruence has an adverse impact on their health and wellbeing.

GnRH agonists can also be used to treat precocious puberty in children. In adults, they can be used to treat endometriosis, breast and prostate cancer, and polycystic ovary syndrome.

The evidence brief examines their use in the context of delaying puberty in adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria.

## Prescription of puberty blockers in New Zealand

In recent years, there has been an increasing awareness of puberty blockers as an option for gender affirming care. This has likely led to an increase in prescribing.

A review of prescribing data shows a fivefold increase in the number of young people 10-19 years of age receiving first time prescriptions of GnRH agonists between 2010 to 2022. Whilst this is a significant increase, it equates to less than one in 3,000 young people being started on these medicines.

While these medicines are not approved by Medsafe for the purpose of delaying puberty, clinicians can still prescribe them under Section 25 of the Medicines Act. Use of Section 25 is common in clinical practise particularly in paediatric services. Other examples of medications prescribed to young people under Section 25 are fluoxetine for depression and melatonin for insomnia.

When authorised prescribers first prescribe an unapproved medicine they are expected to be working within their scope of practice. In addition, there is a clear expectation that the person is aware that the medicine is being used for an unapproved use and that there is an informed conversation about the potential risks and benefits, involving family/whānau/caregivers where appropriate.

Medical practitioners are expected to meet professional practice and ethical standards and ensure the provisions of the Code of Health and Disability Services Consumer Rights are met.

Clinicians should take a holistic approach to the provision of gender affirming care. Puberty blockers are one of a range of options clinicians should discuss with individuals and their families.

## What is happening in other countries?

The World Health Organisation (WHO) is in the process of developing a guideline on the health of transgender and gender diverse people including health policies and legal recognition of self-determined gender identity. While these are not legally binding, they may influence any current or future governance and legal structures.

England, Finland, Norway, and Sweden have recently decided to limit the prescription of puberty blockers for young people seeking gender affirming care to clinical trials. Those countries are concerned about the lack of high-quality evidence regarding outcomes for the use of puberty blockers for gender incongruence and dysphoria. England's independent

review¹ identified gaps in interprofessional approaches and variability in service access by patients. In Sweden there were concerns relating to consent, and the lack of data to understand the context in which puberty blockers were being used.

In most Australian states and territories the prescription of puberty blockers for people under 18 years requires consent from all parties who have parental responsibility for the young person.

Other countries such as Canada and the Netherlands, continue to enable the prescription of puberty blockers through clinical processes involving individuals and their whānau/families, as part of comprehensive gender affirming care, although Alberta in Canada is currently considering banning the use of puberty blockers in children under 16.

## Evidence brief findings

### Scope of the evidence brief

The evidence brief considers international and national literature, published up until 30 September 2023.

### Findings

The full evidence brief can be found here. Key findings are:

*   There is some evidence that for those on puberty blockers, bone density appears to increase at less than the expected rate for individual stage of development.
*   Organ systems are often impacted by hormone medication. However, for those on puberty blockers, there appears to be no evidence of impact on renal or liver function, the onset of diabetes, or fertility.
*   Whilst there are some studies that suggest an improvement in depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation for individuals treated with puberty blockers, the quality of the evidence is poor.

Overall, the evidence brief found limitations in the quality of evidence for either the benefits or risks (or lack thereof) of the use of puberty blockers. This means there is insufficient basis to say that puberty blockers are safe or reversible (or not) for use in gender dysphoria in adolescents.

## The Ministry of Health's position on the use of puberty blockers

The prescription of medication to delay the onset of puberty in young people is a complex issue. The Ministry of Health acknowledges that there are strong and varied views relating to the area of gender affirming healthcare. At the centre are the young people seeking gender affirming care.

It is the role of the Ministry to ensure everyone in New Zealand can access high quality health care that meets their needs. Young people who experience Gender incongruence or dysphoria have complex needs requiring a range of psychological and medical supports. Puberty blockers can be used as part of a comprehensive care plan.

However, given the limitations in the quality of evidence, there is a need for high-quality, longitudinal data and research to understand the benefits and risks of puberty blockers when used for treatment of gender incongruent/dysphoric young people in New Zealand.

## Information for health professionals

Like all health care it is important that individuals (and their whānau) discuss with their clinician the potential benefits and risks of using puberty blockers in their context.

Clinicians initiating puberty blockers should be experienced in providing gender affirming care and be part of an inter-professional team.

Given the paucity of evidence around their impact, healthcare professionals should ensure clinical conversations about puberty blockers reflect the lack of evidence regarding their benefits and risks.

Young people who experience gender incongruence also experience higher rates of anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. They should have timely access to therapeutic supports which meet their mental health needs.

## Information for people and whānau

It is important to note that gender affirming care is broader than just the prescription of puberty blockers.

People presenting to clinicians with gender incongruence/dysphoria will continue to receive advice and care from healthcare professionals.

Anyone experiencing gender incongruence can get advice through their general practice team, who can help them to access care and support.

No medical intervention is entirely without risk. Clinicians will continue to provide careful guidance to and follow up for people and families considering gender affirming care, taking individual circumstances into account.

## Next steps

Young people experiencing gender incongruence/dysphoria should have access comprehensive quality care. To that end the Ministry of Health will consider the following options:

*   Commissioning New Zealand research to determine the long-term clinical and mental health and wellbeing impacts of puberty blockers in young people with gender incongruence/dysphoria.
*   Working with Health New Zealand to establish clinical governance structures, incorporating services initiating puberty blockers, to oversee the safe and evidence-based delivery of gender affirming care.
*   Exploring the feasibility of applying additional criteria or conditions on the prescription of puberty blockers for gender affirming care.

Health New Zealand is currently developing an updated set of guidance to support clinicians providing gender affirming care, including the use of puberty blockers. The evidence brief will be available to inform those guidelines. The updated guidelines are expected to be complete by September 2024.

The Ministry will continue to monitor emerging evidence in the field of gender affirming care and to review the international context in relation to the use of puberty blockers.

The Ministry will work closely with Health New Zealand and other partners to ensure young people experiencing gender incongruence/dysphoria have access to care which meets their needs.
