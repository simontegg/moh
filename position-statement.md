title: Position Statement on the Use of Puberty Blockers in Gender-Affirming Care
---

## Purpose

This position statement accompanies the release of an evidence brief which examines the safety and long-term impacts of puberty blockers. This statement summarises the brief's findings and sets out the Ministry of Health's expectations regarding the use of puberty blockers for gender-affirming care¹. It outlines our next steps that will ensure young people with gender incongruence and gender dysphoria have access to quality care. It also provides relevant information for health professionals, rainbow communities, and the general public.

## Background

In September 2022, the Ministry of Health updated its position on the safety and reversibility of puberty blockers when used for gender affirming care. This was in light of work underway in other jurisdictions examining the clinical effects of puberty blockers on adolescents. The evidence brief examines the risks and benefits of puberty blockers when used for gender-affirming care.

## Reasons for prescription of puberty blockers

Puberty blockers, or gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are used to treat precocious puberty² in children. In adults, the same medications can be used to treat endometriosis, breast and prostate cancer, and polycystic ovary syndrome.

Puberty blockers can also be used as part of gender-affirming care to delay the onset of puberty by suppressing oestrogen and testosterone. Clinicians can prescribe them to young people experiencing gender incongruence or gender dysphoria.

> ¹ Gender-affirmative health care can include any single or combination of a number of social, psychological, behavioural or medical (including hormonal treatment or surgery) interventions designed to support and affirm an individual's gender identity https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/frequently-asked-questions/gender-incongruence-and-transgender-health-in-the-icd

> ² Precocious puberty (PP) is defined as the development of pubertal changes, at an age younger than the accepted lower limits for age of onset of puberty, namely, before age 8 years in girls and 9 years in boys https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21064-precocious-early-puberty

Gender incongruence is where an individual's experienced gender and their assigned sex (at birth) persistently do not match.

Gender dysphoria is where an individual's gender incongruence has an adverse impact on their health and wellbeing.

The evidence brief examines their use in the context of delaying puberty in adolescents experiencing gender incongruence or gender dysphoria.

## Prescription of puberty blockers in New Zealand

In recent years, there has been an increasing awareness of puberty blockers as an option for gender-affirming care. A preliminary review of prescribing data shows a steady increase in the number of young people aged 10-19 receiving first-time prescriptions of GnRH agonists between 2010 and 2022. Other countries have observed a similar increase in prescribing of puberty blockers although due to the quality of the data, meaningful direct comparison of prescribing rates is not possible.

While these medications are not approved by Medsafe for the purpose of delaying puberty, clinicians can still prescribe them “off label” under section 25 of the Medicines Act, 1981³. Use of section 25 is common in clinical practice particularly in paediatric services. Other examples of medications prescribed to young people under section 25 are fluoxetine for depression and melatonin for insomnia.

When authorised prescribers prescribe an unapproved medication they are expected to be working within their scope of practice. Clinicians need to make sure that the person receiving the medication knows that the medication is being used for an unapproved use and have an informed conversation with them about the potential risks and benefits, involving family/whānau/caregivers where appropriate.

Medical practitioners are expected to meet professional practice and ethical standards and also ensure that they meet the provisions of the Code of Health and Disability Services Consumer Rights.

Clinicians should take a holistic approach and undertake a comprehensive assessment in the provision of gender-affirming care. Puberty blockers are one of a range of options (e.g., medical, mental health and social support) clinicians can discuss with individuals and their families.

> ³ Section 25 of the Medicines Act allows an authorised prescriber to "procure the sale or supply of any medicine" for a patient in their care. This means that prescribers may prescribe any medicine to a patient (within their scope of practice), regardless of whether it is approved or unapproved in New Zealand.

## The international context

The World Health Organization (WHO) is in the process of developing a guideline on the health of transgender and gender-diverse people including health policies and legal recognition of self-determined gender identity. While the guideline will not be legally binding, it may influence current or future governance and legal structures.

England, Finland, Norway, and Sweden have recently decided to limit the prescription of puberty blockers for young people seeking gender-affirming care to clinical trials. Those countries have expressed concerns about the lack of high-quality evidence on outcomes in the use of puberty blockers for gender incongruence and gender dysphoria. NHS England's independent review⁴ identified gaps in interprofessional approaches and variability in service access by patients. In Sweden⁵ there were concerns relating to the consent process, and a lack of data to understand the context in which puberty blockers have been used.

In most Australian states and territories, the prescription of puberty blockers for people aged under 18 years requires consent from the young person, treating clinician and all parties who have parental responsibility for the young person. Prescribing is "off-label” however, the medications are not funded through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.

Other countries, such as Canada and the Netherlands, continue to enable the prescription of puberty blockers through clinical processes involving individuals and their families, as part of comprehensive gender-affirming care. However, the Canadian province of Alberta is currently considering banning the use of puberty blockers for young people aged under 16 years.

## Evidence brief findings

### Scope of the evidence brief

The evidence brief considers international and national literature, published up until 30 September 2023.

Other international analyses and reports have been released since our evidence brief was completed. Our assessment of these reports is that there is no new evidence that has been published since September 2023 that is materially different from that included in our evidence brief.

### Findings

The full evidence brief can be found on the Ministry of Health website. Key findings are as follows:

*   There is some evidence that for people treated with puberty blockers, bone density appears to increase at less than the expected rate for individual stage of development.
*   Organ systems are often impacted by hormone medication. However, for those on puberty blockers, there is no evidence of impact on renal or liver function, the onset of diabetes, or fertility.
*   Whilst there are some studies that suggest an improvement in depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation for individuals treated with puberty blockers, the quality of the evidence is poor.

Overall, the evidence brief found limitations in the quality of evidence for either the benefits or risks (or lack thereof) of the use of puberty blockers. This means there is insufficient basis to say that puberty blockers are safe or reversible (or not) for use as an intervention for gender dysphoria in adolescents.

## The Ministry of Health's position on the use of puberty blockers

The prescription of medication to delay the onset of puberty in young people is a complex issue. The Ministry of Health acknowledges that there are strong and varied views relating to the area of gender-affirming healthcare. In relation to the use of puberty blockers, the Ministry is also aware of a range of experiences and views among young people, who have lived experience of gender incongruence/dysphoria.⁶

It is the Ministry's role to ensure everyone in New Zealand can access high quality health care that meets their needs. Young people who experience gender incongruence or gender dysphoria have complex needs and require a range of psychological and medical supports. With informed consent, puberty blockers are one option that can be used as part of a comprehensive care plan.

> ⁶ Young people have rights under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) to both identity (Article 8) and to health (physical, mental), including equitable access to health care (Article 24). These rights sit among children's wider range of holistic rights under the CRC, which also includes the right and general principle that all decisions made about/in relation to a child must be made in their best interests (Article 3), and the right and general principle to non-discrimination (Article 2) and to life, survival and development (Article 6).

## Information for health professionals

In any health care context, it is important that clinicians discuss the potential benefits and risks of using particular medications, including puberty blockers with individuals and their whānau.

Clinicians who initiate puberty blockers should be experienced in providing gender-affirming care and be part of an interprofessional team. The importance in this context is that mental health issues, which can be wide-ranging, and other commonly concurrent presentations should be addressed alongside treatment for gender incongruence or gender dysphoria.

Young people who experience gender incongruence also experience higher rates of anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. They should have timely access to therapeutic supports which meet their mental health needs.

There is a paucity of evidence on the impact of puberty blockers. The Ministry expects healthcare professionals to ensure that clinical conversations about puberty blockers reflect the paucity of evidence regarding their benefits and risks.

## Information for young people and whānau

It is important to note that gender-affirming care is broader than just the prescription of puberty blockers.

People with gender incongruence or gender dysphoria will continue to receive advice and care from healthcare professionals.

Anyone experiencing gender incongruence can get advice through their general practice team who can help them to access care and support.

No medical intervention is entirely without risk. Clinicians will continue to provide careful guidance to and follow-up for people and families considering gender-affirming care, taking individual circumstances into account.

## Next steps

Young people experiencing gender incongruence or gender dysphoria should have access to comprehensive quality care. To that end, the Ministry of Health will:

*   continue to seek expert advice that considers system wide issues relating to gender-affirming care
*   work with Health New Zealand – Te Whatu Ora to establish clinical governance structures, incorporating services initiating puberty blockers, to oversee the safe and evidence-based delivery of gender-affirming care.
*  explore the feasibility of introducing additional criteria or conditions for the prescription of puberty blockers for gender-affirming care.
*  undertake audit to evaluate the quality of gender-affirming service provision in New Zealand. In the longer-term, we will also commission New Zealand research to determine the long-term clinical and mental health and wellbeing impacts of puberty blockers in young people with gender incongruence or gender dysphoria.

Health New Zealand is currently developing an updated set of guidance to support clinicians providing gender-affirming care, including the use of puberty blockers. The evidence brief will be available to inform those guidelines. The updated guidelines are expected to be complete by September 2024.

The Ministry will continue to monitor emerging evidence in the field of gender-affirming care and to review the international context in relation to the use of puberty blockers.

The Ministry will work closely with Health New Zealand and other partners to ensure young people experiencing gender incongruence or gender dysphoria have access to care which meets their physical and mental health needs and upholds their holistic range of rights as young people.
